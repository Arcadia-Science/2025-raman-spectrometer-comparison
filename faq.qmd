# What is this?

This notebook publication (or "notebook pub") is an experimental format we're testing that treats a scientist's working computational analysis as the publication itself, effectively dissolving the separation that exists between code and publication. This approach reduces publication burden by avoiding format translation, promotes sharing of early-stage work, and gives readers direct access to interact with and build upon the analysis. For more information about this experimental format, see [our commentary on notebook publications](FIXME).
