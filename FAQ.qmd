# FAQ

## What is this?

This *notebook publication* uses a format we're experimenting with that treats a scientist's working computational analysis as the publication itself, dissolving the separation that exists between code and publication. Our hypothesis is that this lets us publish faster, promote early-stage work, and increase reproducibility. For details, see [our commentary](FIXME) on notebook publications.
